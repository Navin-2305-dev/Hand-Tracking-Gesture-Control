# Hand Tracking Gesture Control

This project uses hand tracking to recognize hand gestures and allow users to interact with a visual interface. The implementation utilizes the `cvzone` library for hand detection and OpenCV for capturing video frames.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture recognition using a webcam.
- Supports up to two hands for gesture detection.
- Displays hand gesture outputs in the console.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- cvzone

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install cvzone
